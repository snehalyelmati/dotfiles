## Pre-requisites

- [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage dotfiles/configurations.
- The dotfiles directory should be in **_home_** (for example, ~/dotfiles) to avoid additional flags like `--target`, though it is unavoidable when we have to stow files in a specific directory like **_root_** .

## Installation

Configuration can be done using the following commands,

```
// default: to stow dotfiles w.r.t the home folder
$ stow nvim

// to stow dotfiles w.r.t a specific folder, e.g root
$ stow --target=/ intel-graphics
```

### Important Notes

- All the folders in the repo **_except_** the `images` folder can be stowed, it has the images for the `README.md` file.
- Following folders have to be stowed from the **_root_** directory,
  - `intel-graphics` - config file to fix screen-tearing on Arch based systems, to be used with [xf86-video-intel](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-video-intel) driver. Refer to this section in the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics#Xorg_configuration) for more details.
  - `fonts` - `/usr/share/fonts` to make fonts available for all users.
- All the other folders except the ones mentioned above can be stowed from the **_home_** directory.
